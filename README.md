# 🎓 Blind Speech Separation in Reverberant Rooms (Master's Dissertation)

This repository contains the implementation developed for my Master's dissertation. 
The dissertation can be seen <[here](https://www.ppgee.ufmg.br/defesas/2193M.PDF)>.

## 📌 Topic

Blind Speech Separation in reverberant environments using:

### Frequency-Domain Independent Component Analysis (FDICA)

* Natural Gradient

* Fast (fixed-point iteration)

*Auxiliary Function method

### Independent Vector Analysis (IVA)

* Natural Gradient

* Fast (fixed-point iteration)

* Auxiliary Function method

## 🎯 Objective

To separate multiple speech sources recorded in reverberant rooms without prior knowledge of the mixing system (blind source separation problem).

🛠 Methods

The work focuses on frequency-domain approaches for convolutive mixtures and compares different optimization strategies for FDICA and IVA.

📚 Context

Master’s dissertation in Electrical Engineering, focused on audio signal processing and blind source separation.
